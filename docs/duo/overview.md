# Introduction
Milk-V Duo is an ultra-compact embedded development platform based on the CV1800B chip. It can run Linux and RTOS, providing a reliable, low-cost, and high-performance platform for professionals, industrial ODMs, AIoT enthusiasts, DIY hobbyists, and creators.  

The Milk-V Duo 256M is an upgraded version of Duo with a memory boost to 256M, catering to applications demanding larger memory capacities. It features the SG2002 computing series chip, elevating computational power to 1.0TOPS@INT8. It enables seamless switching between RISC-V/ARM architectures and supports simultaneous operation of dual systems. Additionally, it includes an array of rich GPIO interfaces such as SPI, UART, suitable for a wide range of hardware development in edge intelligent monitoring, including IP cameras, smart peephole locks, visual doorbells, and more.

Milk-V Duo S is an upgraded model of Duo, featuring an upgraded SG2000 main controller with a larger 512MB memory and expanded IO capabilities. It integrates wireless capabilities with WI-FI 6/BT 5, and comes equipped with a USB 2.0 HOST interface and a 100Mbps Ethernet port for user convenience. Supporting dual cameras (2x MIPI CSI 2-lane) and MIPI video output (MIPI DSI 4-lane), it allows for versatile applications. The device also supports switching between RISC-V and ARM boot through a switch. With enhanced functionality, Duo S is better suited for a variety of scenarios with more complex project development requirements.

The Duo Module 01 is a compact module with integrated SG2000, WI-FI6/BTDM5.4, and eMMC. It supports SMD mounting. Also it can greatly save product development time. It is the first choice for making products.To enhance your development experience with the Duo Module 01, Milk-V provides the DuoModule 01 Evaluation Board, which is designed to facilitate your development evaluation and provide you with reference designs.
